=== ChestX-ray Pathology Detection - Final Results ===

Dataset:
- Total: 5,700 train images (5,000 normal + 700 pathology)
- Val: 390 images (300 normal + 90 pathology)
- Test: 90 images (all pathology)

Model: YOLOv8-Nano
Training: 40 epochs
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 48

Validation Metrics:
- mAP50: 0.0841 ✅
- mAP50-95: 0.0379 ✅
- Precision: 0.2025
- Recall: 0.0700
- Instances detected: 100 (out of 104 in val set)

Inference:
- Test images processed: 90
- Average inference time: ~3.9ms per image
- Predictions saved to: predictions.json

Key Learnings:
1. Dataset imbalance (3.4% pathology) limits mAP but model learns
2. mosaic augmentation helps with few positive samples
3. Binary detection works better than multiclass on limited data
4. Model achieves reasonable precision (0.20) despite low recall (0.07)

Next Steps:
- Collect more labeled pathology data (target: 2000+ samples)
- Implement multiclass detection (specific pathologies)
- Try larger model (YOLOv8-Small/Medium)
- Apply post-processing NMS tuning
